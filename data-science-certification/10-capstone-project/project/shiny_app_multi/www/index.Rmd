## User Guide for Predictive Text Shiny App

### Initial note
**WARNING.** Sometimes, the pages of the application become grey. On the local system, the visualization is perfect. I think it depends on the server and not on the application. Therefore, please, if the page turns gray be patient and reload/refresh the application or wait some time and retry.

### ShinyApp Description
**Main page**

When the application is started, it appears the main page of the application that contains:

- on the top, a link to this user guide
- in the middle, **three links**, one for each different context: Twitter, Blogs and News
- on the bottom, some links to useful documentation: the initial exploratory analysis, a desk slide presentation and the source code of the project.

To continue, a style has to be chosen clicking on one of the three links in the middle, Twitter, Blogs or News. Then a new application is started for the specific context. 

**Specific application page**

This second application is specific for the style chosen. Different colors are used to differentiate the layout: yellow for Twitter, purple for News and green for Blogs as in the exploratory analysis plots.

The page contains a colored **text area** where it is possible to write. The text area is resizable clicking on the bottom left corner of the area itself. During the typing, **three buttons** appear above the text area. **WARNING.** It takes some second to visualize the buttons above the text area, so please be patient and wait the buttons appearing before starting to write in the text area.

The buttons show the **three most likely words** predicted: the most lower is the first, the right one is the second and the left one is the third. If there is a space after the last word typed, the algorithm predicts the next word, otherwise implements sentence completion with prediction. If a button is pressed, the word displayed on it is pasted into the text area to complete the sentence.

The Reset button cleans the text area to restart writing.
